Napkin Math reference numbers

](https://github.com/sirupsen/napkin-math#numbers)

A newsletter about using napkin math and first-principle thinking to estimate systems performance fast, and without writing any code! However, on a good day posts will include code to test whether the napkin math lines up with reality. If it doesn’t, it’s the more cause for an interesting post.

> What is the expected throughput of a single-threaded, in-memory data-store like Redis? — [Issue 4](https://sirupsen.com/napkin/problem-4)

> Is fsyncs per seconds and transactions per second for MySQL always the same? — [Issue 10](https://sirupsen.com/napkin/problem-10-mysql-transactions-per-second)

> What do you expect the response time for a query that visits 50 database pages with a 80% page cache hit rate to be? — [Issue 2](https://sirupsen.com/napkin/problem-2)

With the napkin math [reference numbers](https://github.com/sirupsen/napkin-math#numbers) in hand and some reasonable assumptions (such as average log size or database record size) we should be able to arrive at an approximate answer!

[This talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxkSlnrRFqc) is the best primer on the topic.

I believe that first-principle thinking is *required* to break out of iterative improvement and make order of magnitude improvements.
