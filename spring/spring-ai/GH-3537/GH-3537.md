[Bug: DefaultAroundAdvisorChain fails to maintain immutability across multiple calls #3537](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/issues/3537)
# Bug description
Current implementation of `DefaultAroundAdvisorChain` has a design issue where the chain's state is being polluted after the first call, making it impossible to reuse the chain for multiple calls. This violates the immutability principle that should be maintained by the chain.
# Steps to reproduce
1. Create a chain with multiple advisors (including intermediate and terminal advisors)
2. Attempt to call the same chain instance multiple times
3. Observe that the chain's state is being polluted after the first call
# Expected behavior
- The chain should be truly immutable
- Multiple calls to the same chain instance should produce consistent results
- The chain should be reusable without any state pollution
- Each call should maintain the correct execution order: head before -> middle before -> tail -> middle after -> head after
# Reproducible example

```java
/**
 * Tests that the chain is truly immutable and can be reused multiple times.
 * This test uses real advisors that delegate to the next advisor in the chain.
 */
 @Test
 void callAdvisorChainShouldBeReusable() {
	 // Track execution order
	 List<String> executionOrder = new ArrayList<>();
 }
```
