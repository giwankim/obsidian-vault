### Amazon Principal Architect shares his secrets for the last month of collaborations guest post

Hi fellow High Growth Engineer, Jordan here 👋

This is the final month of collaborations guest post! Today’s special guest is [Prasad Rao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kprasadrao/). As a Principal Solutions Architect at AWS and author of [Behavioral OS for Techies](https://behavioralosfortechies.substack.com/), Prasad has seen the **biggest mistakes and successes during interviews**.

He’s going to share how you can avoid getting down-leveled from your behavioral interview using a simple, 3-step framework for answering questions. It shows you the exact **content** to include in the **structure** that the STAR framework provides, making you **stand out, get hired, and avoid being downleveled** in interviews.

Without further ado, I’ll pass the mic 🎤 to Prasad 👏

Over the last five years, I have had the opportunity to interview many talented people for different roles at Amazon.

Most of the candidates have impressive resumes and work experiences. However, only a select few are able to articulate their experiences in a way that truly reflects senior-level expertise.

I have seen people being offered the level lower than they applied for or they thought they deserved based on their experience. And that happens only because they are not able to showcase their level of seniority during the interviews.

In this article, I'll illustrate how an interviewer decides which level they should be hiring the candidates for based on the answer they provide to a behavioral question.

## ⭐️ Main takeaways

- How to avoid being down-leveled in interviews
- A 3-step framework for turning a basic answer into a Senior level answer
- A template for preparing Senior-level answers in your interviews

## 🔬 The Three Pillars of Senior-Level Responses

In your day-to-day activities, you'll be working on multiple tasks. Some will be classified as junior-level tasks and others will be classified as senior-level tasks.

![Your experience is comprised of a bunch of different tasks, some junior-level and others senior-level. What you focus on sharing in interviews matters](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Pb1d!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc48c60dc-a323-40df-8d3b-55e93abff9b4_1600x719.png)

Your experience is comprised of a bunch of different tasks, some junior-level and others senior-level. What you focus on sharing in interviews matters

During an interview, the interviewer will make a perception about your seniority level based on the answers you provide.

I’ll focus on 3 main pillars of how you can enhance your answers to position yourself as a senior engineer:

1. **Scope and Impact**
2. **Technical Depth and Complexity**
3. **Leadership and Collaboration**

## ❌ What most people do

Here’s a common behavioral question engineers get asked:

> *Tell me about a time when you had to dive deep to find the root cause of an issue and resolve it.*

Here is an example of an answer that an engineer would provide:

> *Our e-commerce site was loading slowly, especially during busy times.*
>
> *I was asked to help speed it up.*
>
> *I used Chrome DevTools to check the page performance and saw that the product images were taking too long to load. I compressed the images and implemented lazy loading for images below the fold.*
>
> *This made the page load about 30% faster, and that significantly improved our end-customer experience.*

The above answer is decent 🤷♂️

It follows the **Situation-Task-Action-Result (STAR)** format. It provides a clear picture to the interviewer along with the data points. It leaves enough room for the interviewer to ask follow-up questions.

However, this answer won't be enough to get you hired at a senior level. Here's why this answer misses the mark:

- It doesn't convey the scale of the problem
- It doesn’t showcase the depth of expertise required
- It doesn’t mention leadership or collaboration with other team members and stakeholders.

Let's look at how to fix each of these issues individually.

### Step 1: Situation

You should highlight the **scope** and **impact** early when covering the **“Situation.”** Beginning the answer with the scale and significance of the problem will ensure the interviewer does not perceive you as a junior engineer.

Here’s what highlighting the **scope** and **impact** in the “Situation” looks like:

> **❌** ***Before:** Our e-commerce site was loading slowly, especially during busy times.*

> **✅** ***After:** Our e-commerce platform, which handles $10 million in monthly sales, was experiencing slow load times on product pages. It was causing a 5% drop in conversion rates.*

You grab the interviewer’s attention because you framed the issue in terms of high business impact.

Instead of telling the interviewer the pages were loading slowly, you’re telling them that these pages handle $10 million in monthly sales. You also mention the 5% drop in conversion rates.

When you call out these business metrics, it showcases the **scope** and **impact** of the work you’re doing.

### Step 2: Task and Action

Now, let’s update the “ **Task”** and “ **Action”** to show **technical depth, leadership, and collaboration**:

> **❌** ***Before:** I was asked to help speed it up.*
>
> *I used Chrome DevTools to check the page performance and saw that the product images were taking too long to load. I compressed the images and implemented lazy loading for images below the fold.*

> **✅** ***After:** Given the impact, I picked up the task to improve the page load time to under 2 seconds.*
>
> ***I led** a comprehensive optimization effort, involving both front-end and back-end improvements.*
>
> *The backend analysis revealed that database queries were also a significant factor in the slow load times. **Working with the backend team**, we implemented database indexing and query caching, reducing database response times by 50%.*
>
> *On the front-end, I implemented image optimization, and we also introduced a content delivery network (CDN) to serve static assets globally, further reducing latency.*

Now, you show the interviewer you have **technical depth** across the platform, not only a specific part of the application. It also shows them your **leadership** and **collaboration** by leading a cross-team optimization effort.

The “before” focused on junior-level tasks, like being assigned to fix a bug. The “after” focuses on the senior-level tasks like technical complexity, leadership, and collaboration. By focusing on the latter, you avoid getting downleveled.

![Before and after diagram of junior vs. senior level tasks you highlight. When you highlight the senior-level tasks, you don't get downleveled](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AZxB!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13ae5325-2543-428a-b398-5cb9732a79b0_1600x902.png)

If you focus too much on the junior-level tasks you did, you’ll be down-leveled

Be cautious though—adding these details can be a double-edged sword. The interviewer will ask follow-up questions and if you get stuck answering them, you’ll lose the interviewer’s trust. If you can’t answer follow-up questions, it’s better to stick to the basic version, which will at least get you hired, although at a lower level.

### Step 3: Results

Let's finish the answer by adding more details to the **result**.

> **❌** ***Before:** This made the page load about 30% faster, and that significantly improved our end-customer experience.*

> **✅** ***After:** These combined efforts resulted in a 30% reduction in overall page load times, bringing us well **under our 2-second target**. The improvements led to a **15% increase in conversion rates**, boosting **monthly revenue by $1.5 million**.*

Now, this is a great answer with a lot of data points. It talks about the overall revenue impact of the task. Be ready to explain them in the follow-up questions.

If in your current role, you’re not aware of the business impact you’re making, ASK! Always try to understand **WHY** of a TASK you’re doing. Knowing the big picture helps you when you make a case for your promotion or when you interview.

The interviewer will try and peel the onion layer by layer to understand if you’re faking or have actually worked on the complex project at the level you claim.

### Putting it all together

Using the 3 step framework to showcase your seniority, you can view using the STAR format like this:

![Situation maps to Scope and Impact, Task and Action maps to technical depth and complexity, leadership and collaboration and finally map the result to impact and scope 1 more time](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uF_c!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a4c340c-f9d2-4793-9af9-b39e4dcb9b54_1600x512.png)

When you should talk about each pillar in your answer

- **Situation**: The situation section should articulate the **scope** and business **impact** of the work you’re doing. It should reflect why a senior engineer's involvement is required in this scenario.
- **Task and Action**: This section should showcase the **complexity** of the overall project and demonstrate your **technical depth** and expertise. This section should also highlight your **leadership** and cross- **collaboration** capabilities to be considered for a senior role.
- **Result**: Tie the outcomes of your work back to the initial situation, reinforcing how your efforts delivered on the project's **scope** and business **impact**. Support it with relevant data and metrics.

In a follow-up article on [my newsletter](https://behavioralosfortechies.substack.com/), I’ll extend this same example to showcase how to answer follow-up questions like:

- Can you elaborate on the challenges you faced during the project?
- How did you measure the success of your project?

## 📖 TL;DR

Senior engineers can navigate between overarching concepts and intricate details of each concept. If you’re preparing for an interview, showcase **your ability to zoom in and out** when you talk about your overall project experience.

To achieve this, start by playing the role of senior in your current project.

The three pillars serve as a framework for you to progress toward a senior role:

1. Scope and Impact
2. Technical Depth
3. Leadership and Collaboration

Use the template below to capture the pillars from projects you worked on and how you’ll answer questions in behavioral interviews.
