### Tech Talks Weekly Extra #13

Happy Tuesday 👋 and welcome to another special edition of Tech Talks Weekly!

Roughly 20% of Tech Talks Weekly readers hold Engineering Leadership roles (EM, EM+, VP, CTO,...), so we prepared a special compilation of talks and podcasts about leadership that we think are the most influential this year.

We believe this list is relevant not just for those in leadership positions, but for everyone across the software engineering spectrum.

We cross-posted this issue to LinkedIn and would **[appreciate your support there](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tech-talks-weekly_must-watch-engineering-leadership-talks-activity-7404136161725665281-8QKE?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABoerrYBMomX2bAheF8u9fNgBhqrIuFYKZk)**.

That all being said, enjoy and expect your watchlist to grow!
